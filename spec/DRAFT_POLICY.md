# Rulia Draft Policy

Status: canonical repo-wide pre-release governance policy.

## 1) Design in Progress
- Rulia is currently in a **Design in Progress** state.
- Concepts, formats, and APIs are subject to change as the design evolves.
- No backward compatibility guarantees are implied or enforced at this stage.

## 2) Stability Posture
- "Freeze" or "Stability" language in other documents should be interpreted as intent for a future stable release, not a current constraint.
- Agents and contributors should prioritize design coherence and correctness over maintaining legacy compatibility.
- Breaking changes are permitted and expected during this phase.

## 3) Evolution
- Changes should be driven by architectural coherence (e.g., the "Kernel + Profile" model).
- Legacy artifacts or concepts that conflict with the evolving design should be updated or archived, not preserved.
